## Introduction

In "10 Usability Heuristics", you'll help the developers of this this ride sharing app to improve their bad design, using the Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics in 1 minute!

## What is Heuristics?

Well, a heuristic evaluation is a usability inspection method mainly used to identify any design issues associated with the user interface. Jakob Nielsen’s heuristics are probably the most-used usability heuristics for user interface design. They are called “heuristics” because they are broad rules of thumb and not specific usability guidelines.

## Installation

## Author

Hello, My name is Cristian Garske, I'm 30 years old, I'm a Design student at Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS). I am an Apple Developer Academy alumni - class 2019/20, from Porto Alegre, Brazil. I started developing for iOS three years ago. Last year, I published my first app with a group of Apple Academy colleagues, at the App Store. The app is called Bubble Yonder and is aimed at facilitating the routines of children in the spectrum of autism. I did all the design part, and this playground is the first coding stuff i did, after watching a lot of Swift Classes last year and even online courses.
